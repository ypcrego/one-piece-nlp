AND THE
CASTLE WAS SET
ABLAZE BEFORE
WE COULD
REACH IT.
IN
DESPERATION,
WE ESCAPED WITH
ALLOF OUR
STRENGTH,
AND LEFT THE
EXECUTION SITE TO
HEAD TO ODEN
CASTLE.
BUT AT
THAT POINT,IT DID
NOT MATTERWHO
DIED.WEABSOLUTELY
NEEDEDTOGET TO
ODEN CASTLE.
OROCHI,WHO
ORCHESTRATED THE
DOWNFALL OF THE
KOZUKI CLAN, WOULD
SURELY TARGET LORD
MOMONOSUKE'S LIFE
NEXT..!
ES...BUT AT
THAT POINT,NO ONE
WAS ON OUR SIDE
ANYMORE...
IT'S PRETTY
IMPRESSIVE THAT YOU
GUYS WERE ABLE TO
ESCAPE SAFELY FROM
SUCH A CRAPPY
SITLATION.
ON OUR
WAYTHERE,
NEKOMAMUSHI
AND INUARASHI
STARTED TO
ARGUE IT
OUT.
THEY
WERE CAUGHT
BYOROCHI'S
SUBORDINATES
AND WE BELIEVED
THEIR LIVES TO
BE FORFEIT.
KAIDOU
ANTICIPATED
OUR PLAN..
EVER...
HOW-
