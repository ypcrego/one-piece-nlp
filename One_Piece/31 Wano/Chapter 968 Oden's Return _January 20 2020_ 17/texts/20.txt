BUT
THANKS
TO THAT
TITLE,
WHILE THE SPELLING OF
ONE PIECE
IS NO DIFFERENT FROM USUAL, OUR TRANSLATOR NOTICED THAT
THE FURIGANA USED TO INDICATE THAT THE TERM IS
SUPPOSED TO BE READ AS ONE PIECE
THE HIRAGANA USED TO INDICATE THE NAME
ONE PIECE HAS A TRUE MEANING, BUT
TIS LEFTAMBIGIOUSBYITS SPELLING
T COULD EITHER BE
THE GREAT HIDDEN TREASURE THAT CONNECTS PEOPLE
OR
THE GREAT HIDDEN TREASURE OF ONE PEACE
JUST A LITTLE FUN SPECULATION ON THE TEAM'S PART.
HAHAHA
