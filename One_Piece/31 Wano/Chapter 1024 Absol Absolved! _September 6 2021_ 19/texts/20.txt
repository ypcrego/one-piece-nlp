Kaido's thunderous arrow attack is
a reference Indra's weapon Vajra
The Thunderbolt).It can also mean
indestructible.adamant.or diamond
There is a clear intent to contrast
it with Yamato's attack in terms
of the intensity of the sound
that's insinuated by the names
Kaido's being much more
abrasively loud thanYamato's
CHAPTER NOTES:
Yamato's plight in the cave is a reference to a legend
about Amaterasu, the Shinto sun goddess.In the story
Amaterasu was pestered by her trouble making little brother,
Susano,until she was depressed enough to shut herself away
in Amano-lwato,a heavenly cave.As a result of her absence
the world was enshrouded in darkness.
A myriad of gods gathered to try to find a solution to this problem
Omoikane, the god of wisdom, suggested that they line up a bunch
of roosters to lure Amaterasu out of the cave with their long
beautiful crows.In the end Ame-no-Uzume was able to get
Amaterasu to leave the cave by dancing and thus,light returned
to the world. This folktale explains why roosters crow at dawn
and is the origin of the traditional Kagura dance.
Usohachi's self proclaimed title in Japanese is "the Hunter of
Two Fellows," this comes from the raw translation for the Flying
Six (Flying Six Fellows). To adapt this we decided to call him
the Beast Hunter, to play off the Beast Pirates as a whole
