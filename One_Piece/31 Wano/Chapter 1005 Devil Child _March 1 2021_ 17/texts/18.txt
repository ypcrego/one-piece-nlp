scaring townsfolk and stealing the souls of those who get too close
One of the most famous legends regarding Wanyudo is as follows
As he rolls through a town, a woman peeks out her window and stares at him
Wanyudo tells her "instead of looking at me, look at your own child
The woman looks down to see her baby in a pool of blood, with its legs ripped off
She looks back at Wanyudo in horror to see her baby's legs in his mouth.

Sanji
To clarify In this chapter Sanji tries to put his CoA up
but he is unable to as it's already ingrained in his
subconsciousness not to hurt a lady
After all, Haki is willpower
