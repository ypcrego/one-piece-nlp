FIRST TIME

SUCHA
THING.
THERE IS NO
SENSE OF
BALANCE
BETWEEN
NATURE AND
CIVILIZATION.

NEVER THOUGHT
THAT ONE WOULD
BE BURIED UNDER
ATREE.
THEYDIDN'T
PREDICT THE
GROWTHOF
THE TREE..
WE WON'T
SEE GOD
ATTHIS
RATE.
THERE IS NO
WAY TO ENTER
THAT FOREST.

SIGNIFICANT?
HEY,NAMI!

FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO CROSS THIS
RIVER,
