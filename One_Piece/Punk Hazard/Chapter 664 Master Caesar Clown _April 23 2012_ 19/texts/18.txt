THISMANIS
DANGEROUS!!
SO IN FACTTHE
ONE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT HUGE
INCIDENT IS?!
CEASAR CLOWN MADE
THE WEAPON AND WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR
LETTING IT GO OFF
ACCIDENTALLY.
BUT OF COURSE THE
DEVELOPMENT OF
A MASS MURDER
WEAPON THAT
SPREADS POISON
GAS IS ILLEGAL.
CEASAR WAS
CALGHT ONE,BUT
HIS ABILITY IS
STRONG.....
AND WE
DON'T STOP
HIM SOON....
HE'LL CAUSE
ANOTHER
OUTRAGEOUS
INCIDENT!!
ONE PIECE
664
WHAT?!
FOR REAL,
SMO-SAN?!
MANGAPANDA.COM
AT THE TIME HE WAS
THE NUMBER2AT THE
SCIENCE SQUADBUT
HIS THINKING IS CRUEL.
HIM AND VEGAPUNK WERE
ALWAYS RIVALLING WITH
EACH OTHER.THAT
INCIDENT ONLY CAUSED
VEGAPUNK'S NAME TO
RISE AS ONE OF THOSE
RESPONSIBLE.
HE ESCAPED THE
PRISON SHIP AND
WAS NEVER SEEN
AGAIN.
IF CEASAR IS
REALLY CONTINUING
HIS RESEARCH ON
THIS ISLAND
MARINE
SIDE.
