HOW'D YOU
KNOW THERE
WAS A RIVER
BEHIND THE ICE
SMO-YAN?!
AT THIS GAS-RIDDEN
ISLAND?!
YOU MEAN THERE'S
PEOPLE LIVING HERE?!
RIDICULOUS...THEY'D
HAVE TOLIVE
WEARING MASKS!
OR ARTIFICIALLY
MADE.
BUT WHETHERTHAT
DRIFT-ICE THAT WAS
BLOCKING IT UP WAS
NATURAL...

BESIDES,THE
PROBLEM ISN'T
THAT THERE WAS
A RIVER

WAS A RIVER
BEHIND THAT
BLOCK OF ICE!!
