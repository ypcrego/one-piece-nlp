WHYDO YOU
REFUSETO
STEPBACK?
THAT IF I WERE TO
TAKE EVEN ONE STEP
BACK RIGHT NOW,I'D
LOSE SOMETHING VERY
IMPORTANT TO ME...
A PROMISE OR OATH...
OR WHATEVER
ITIS WOULD BE
IRREVERSIBLY BROKEN
AND THAT I'D NEVER
BE ABLE TO RETURN
BACK TO WHERE I'M
STANDING RIGHT NOW.
DO YOU WISH
FORMETO
PIERCE YOUR
HEART THUS?
BEATS
ME...NOT
REALLY SURE
MYSELF...
