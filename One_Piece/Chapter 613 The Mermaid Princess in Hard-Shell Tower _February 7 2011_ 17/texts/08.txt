THE
SWORDSMAN,
WHO ARRIVED
AT THE PALACE
AHEAD OF THE
OTHERS,HAS
ALREADY BEEN
APPREHENDED.
...THE DECISION
HAS BEEN MADE TO
CONFINE THE ENTIRE
STRAW HAT CREW
TO THE PALACE
DUNGEONS.
...AH...
IT WOULD SEEM
THAT FIVEMINUTES
HAVE PASSED.
IN THAT
CASE,WE WILL
BE LEAVING!!
THE ONLYPROBLEM IS...
THE CAPTAIN OF THEIR CREW
STRAW HAT LUFFY,WHO WAS
LAST SEEN ENTERING THE
PALACE ALONG WITH THOSE
THREE CREW MEMBERS
SEEMS TO HAVE GONE
MISSING...!!
PRESUMABLY HE
DISCOVERED OUR INTENTIONS
TO APPREHEND HIM SOMEHOW,
AND HAS CONCEALED HIMSELF
SOMEWHERE IN THE PALACE
WE MUST ALL BE ON OUR
GUARD!
LINDER
SUSPICION OF
THE KIDNAPPING
OF THE MISSING
MERMAIDS...
ANDAS
A PRECAUTION
AGAINST THESE
POSSIBLE FUTURE
MISDEEDS...
IT PAINS ME GREATLY
THAT WE ARE FORCED
TOGREET MEGALO'S
SAVIOURS WITH CHAINS
AND CELLS RATHER
THAN THE PLANNED
CELEBRATIONS.
THE THREE FURTHER
CREW MEMBERS WHO
JUST ARRIVED AT THE
CASTLE HAVE MOST
LIKELY BEEN APPRE
HENDED BYNOW AS
WELL...!!
FEAR NOTWE
WILL APPREHEND HIS
OTHER CREWMATES FROM
THEIR VARIOUS LOCATIONS
ACROSS FISHMAN ISLAND
AND ENSURE THE SAFETY
OFOUR PROUD
KINGDOM!!
.ANDAS
