FOLLOWING
THEIR SHIP
WAS A LITTLE
BABY WHALE.
THAT WHALE
WAS LABOON
IT'STHE LARGEST
SPECIES OF WHALE
IN THE WORLD.
THIS ONE'S NAME
IS LABOON.
BECALISE THE MEAT
FROM LABOON CAN
FEED THEIR TOWN
FOR2-3 YEARS.
A CERTAIN GROUP
OF FRIENDLYPIRATES
CAME DOWN REVERSE
MOUNTAIN.
THEIR GOAL
IS TOHUNT
LABOON,
LONG AGOWHILE
I WAS MINDING
MY BUSINESS AS
A LIGHTHOUSE
KEEPER,
AND BELLOWS
WHILE FACING
REVERSE
MOUNTAIN...
THERE'SA
REASON FOR
ALL THAT
TOO.
AS FOR WHY
LABOON KEEPS
ON BASHING HIS
HEAD AGAINST
THEREDLINE,
THIS WHALE IS AN
ISLAND WHALE,
FOUND NORMALLY
IN WEST BLUE.
AND THESE
TWO ARE
ROGUES
FROMA
NEARBY
TOWN...
BUT I WON'T
ALLOW THAT!
