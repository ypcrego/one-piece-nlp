Really.Sowhen you wrote in a sBs in volome 53 that you were going to slowly
O:What do you Mean no question! But aPter I said that in volume 53,I got a
Mountain oP postcards like this,so I was surprised.There's no deep Meaning
behind itUm,Pirstwhen I was talking about an ideal length of publication,I was
thinking about the readers who have to buy all oP the books.As an author,I
always want new readers,but people who started reading in the middle,Por
exampleMight not know that Loppy was the Pirst Member oP the Strawhat
Pirates.I want them to know what kind oP adventores they had and the Priends
this siteAccess it!Adults,you go buy the books,please.)So when I said that
bePoreit was because I was worried about this,so I apologize.It's not like I'M
losing My passion.I've only wanted to do one thing Prom the beginning, and that's
to tell lots oP stories and make an interesting Manga ontil the end.In the big
pictore,One Piece is roughly in its middle third.IP you have time,please stay with
