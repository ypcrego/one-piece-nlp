HIM BEING A
PIRATE ISJUST
ADISGUISE.
HE'S MOST LIKELY
BEEN LOITERING
AROUND THE OCEANS

THE RIGHT TIME TO
COME BACK.
WRONG!

THE KING
AND HIS
SOLDIERS

AND HIS MEN WERE
DRIVEN OUT OF THIS
ISLAND AND FORCED
TO BE PIRATES,

THIS ALL MEAN?
YOU SAID THAT
THE COUNTRY
WAS DESTROYED
BUT THEN WHY IS
THE KING ALIVE
AND WELL BEING
A PIRATE OUT OF
ALL THINGS!?
AFTER BEING
UINABLE TO
FIGHT OFF THE
BLACKBEARD
PIRATES...
