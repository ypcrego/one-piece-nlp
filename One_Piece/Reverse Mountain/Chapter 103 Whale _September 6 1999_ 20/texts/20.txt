BUT TO LABOON,
THOSE PIRATES
WERE HIS POD
MEMBERS.
AND SO,ON THE
DAYOFTHEIR
DEPARTURE, THEIR
CAPTAIN ASKED ME,
"COULD YOU
PLEASE TAKE CARE
OFLABOONFOR
2-3YEARS?
UNDER-
STANDING
THEIR INTENT,
LABOON
PATIENTLY
WAITED FOR
THEMHERE.
NORMALLY,
ISLAND WHALES
ARE KNOWN TO SWIM
TOGETHER INPODS,
BUT FEARING THAT
GRAND LINE WAS
TOO DANGEROUS,
THEYLEFT HIM
BEHIND OR SO
THEYTHOUGHT.
IT SEEMS THAT
LABOON HAD
ACCOMPANIED
THEIR JOURNEY
IN WEST BLUE,
THEIR SHIP
WAS DAMAGED WHEN
THEY ARRIVED SO
THEY STAYED HERE
FOR SEVERAL
MONTHS TO FIX IT.
I BECAME QLITE
GOOD FRIENDS
WITH THEM DURING
THEIR STAY.
"ONCE
WE'VE
SAILED
AROUND
THE WORLD,
WE'LL COME
BACK FOR
ON WIH
MATTER
WHAT."
