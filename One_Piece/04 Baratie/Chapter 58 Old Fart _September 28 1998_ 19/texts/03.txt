ICAN
DEFINITELY
SURVIVE.
IT'S
SIMPLE!
I'M SURE I'LL
BE ABLE TO SPOT
AT LEAST1OR2
SHIPS IF I WAIT
4~5DAYS.
ONE PIECE7
IHAVES
DAYS WORTH
OFFOOD.
IF I CAN WAIT OUT
20 DAYS,I'M SURE
A SHIP WILL PASS
BYHERE,
NOW
LET'S SEE.
BUT
THERE'S PLENTY
OF RAINWATER
TRAPPEDIN THE
CREVICESTHATI
CAN DRINK.SOI
SHOULD BE ABLE
TOGETBY
SOMEHOW.
I'LL GET
TO EAT
LESS PER
DAY,
I CAN SEE
SO FAR AWAY
ACROSS THE
OCEAN.
BESIDES,I
DON'T SEE ANY
WRECKAGE OF
THE PASSENGER
SHIP I WAS ON,
SO IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT THEYMIGHT
COME AND RESCUE
ME.
BUT THINKING
OFTHE WORST
CASE SCENARIO,
IT'DBEBEST TO
SPLIT IT EVENLY
OVER 20DAYS.
