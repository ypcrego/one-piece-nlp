AFTER A FIGHT.
WITH ONE OF
YOUR LEGS GONE
BE ABLE TOFIGHT

I MAY NOT BE ABLE
TOFIGHT ANYMORE
BUT I CAN STILL
COOK AS LONG AS I
HAVE THESE HANDS.
IT SEEMS
THAT YOU'VE
MANAGED TO
SURVIVE,
THOUGH AT
THE COST OF
ONE OF YOUR
PRECIOUS
YOUR
NICKNAME
"RED-LEG"
REFERS TO
YOUR LEGS,
THOUGH
I'VE HEARD
FROM
RUMOURS
THAT
YOU DIED
DURING A
SHIPWRECK,
