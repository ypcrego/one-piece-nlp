ANDIF
YOU CHANGE
THEYMET THE
VERYSAME
FATE AT HIS
HANDS..
HESTOLE
MONEY AND
PRECIOUS ITEMS,
AND NOTHING
ELSE.
BUT
IPTT TE
OFALL THAT,
HESHOWED
NO INTEREST
IN IMPROVING
HIS STATUS OR
ACQUIRING
TERRITORY.
BEFORE
LONG, THOSE
WHO WOULD
SEEK REVENGE
ON HIM CAME
FOR HIS HEAD
IN DROVES!
WHAT?!
THAT'S BEYOND
TERRIBLE..!
HOWEVER,
IN THIS WORLD
IT'S EYE-FOR-
AN-EYE..
HUDDER
SAYING HE'S A
MAN WITH BAD
TASTE WOULD
BE AN UINDER-
STATEMENT.
I?
HE MERELY
LAUIGHED AS
HE WATCHED THE
POWERS THAT BE
IN THE UNDER-
WORLD PANIC.
WHO'D CUT OFF
ANIMALS HEADS
AND LAUGH AS HE
WATCHED THEIR
WRITHING
BODIES...!
EVEN BACK IN HIS
YOUNGER DAYS HE WAS
ALREADY GUNNING FOR
THE HEADS OFTHE
BOSSES OF THE
LINDERWORLD.
EVEN IF
THEY COMMANDED
AN ENTIRE FAMILY, HE'D
GO STRAIGHT FOR THE
HEAD OF ANY BOSS WHO
DARED RESIST HIM,
AND NO ONE ELSE
FROM THEN
ONHE SAT BACK
AND WATCHED THE
BLOOD-SOAKED
STRUGGLES FOR
POWER.
I'VE HEARD
THAT HE'S
THE SORT
OF MAN...
