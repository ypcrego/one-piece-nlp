WHAT AMI
SUPPOSED
TODO...?
THIS ISLAND
IS NOW
COMPLETELY
UNDER THEIR
CONTROL..
AND THAT THE
ONLYWAY TO
SURVIVE WAS
TO LIVE UNDER
THEIR RULE...
WE WERE NAIVE...!
THE MARINES
WON'T COME TO
SAVE US EITHER.
OF SENDING NAMI
AND NOJIKO AWAY ON
A BOAT IS NOW..
BEEEEEEEEL
EVEN
OUR
IDEA,
THAT IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE
FORUS
TO ESCAPE
FROM THIS
SITUATION...!
ALL THE SHIPS
IN THE VILLAGE
HAVE BEEN
SUNK...
NAMI'S BEEN
TAKEN AWAY
TOO...
BELLEMERE

REALIZED
BACK THEN
