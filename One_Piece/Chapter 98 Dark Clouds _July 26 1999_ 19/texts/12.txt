FOUGHT MY WAY
BACK TO MY
CREW,ALL THE
WHILE WISHING
FOR THE DAY
WHEN I WOULD
KILLYOU.
WAIT,WHY

AM I TELLING
YOUALL
THIS FOR!?
YOU'RE STILL
THE SAME
CHEEKY BRAT
AS EVER,I SEE!
AN ADVENTURE OF
MERRIMENTS,HELLISH
DANGERS, AND FRIENDSHIPS
A MOST GRAND ADVENTURE
FOR THE LITTLE BUGGY! AFTER
MUCH PERSERVERANCE...
OHIT'S
JUST BUGGY.
AND WHAT AN
ADVENTURE IT
WAS FOR I
WHO LACKED
A BODY!

SINCE THE
DAYI WAS
BLASTED
