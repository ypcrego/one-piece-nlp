WHAT?
ON TOP OFTHE
SEA CURRENTS
AND WEATHER,
ISLANDS WILL CHANGE
EVEN THEIR
MAGNETIC FORCE
WHICH YOU WERE
ABLE TORELY

ONLY ONE NEEDLE.

ANY ISLANDS?!
ON THE GRAND LINE,
YOU LOG THE
MAGNETIC
FORCE COMING
FROM THE NEXT
ISLAND
IN THE LOG POSE
ANDSAIL
RELYING ON THAT.....
BUT IN THE
SEAS OF ITS
LATTER HALF
THERE'S
EVEN ISLANDS
WHOSE MAGNETIC
FORCES YOU WILL
LOSE COMPLETELY
WHILE SAILING.
ONE OF
THEM IS SHIFTING
SLIGHTLYLIKE THE
NORMAL LOG POSE
