SURE ENOUGH,
HE COULD BE
FEROCIOUS,SHORT-
TEMPERED AND
SELFISH IF YOU
MADE HIM MAD.
.BUT EVERY ACTION
THAT HE TOOK WAS
AS SIMPLE AND
HONEST AS THAT
OF A CHILD.
I GUESS yOU
REALLY CANT...
GO AGAINST
YOUR BLOOD.
THE WORLD MAY HAVE
SEEN HIM AS THE
ULTIMATE EVIL,BUT
THE TRUST HE EARNED
FROM HIS CREW WAS
IMMEASURABLE.
N-NO,
NOT AT
ALL...!!
..JUST BECAUSE
THEYSPOKE ILL
OF HIS CREW.
IT'S THE FACTTHAT
HE LIVED HIS LIFE
IN THAT WAY AND
STILL HAD THE LUCK
TO SURVIVE THAT
MADE HIM THE
PIRATE KING.
WHAT'S THAT?
YOU HAVE
SOME KIND OF
PROBLEM...?
INACE!
HE WAS EVEN
KNOWN TO WIPE
OUT AN ENTIRE
COUNTRY'S
MILITARY...
..WE'RE
THEONES
WHO'VE TAKEN
EVEN I,AS A MARINE
SOLDIER, COULDN'T
BRING MYSELF TO HATE
THE MAN... THAT'S WHY
I DECIDED TO TAKE
IN ACE..
AT TIMES LIKE
THATROGER
BECAME A TRUE
iiNOWOI
PERHAPS BECAUSE
HE GREW UP IN
CIRCUMSTANCES NOT
UNLIKE THOSE ACE
IS GOING THROUGH
RIGHT NOW..
HE DETESTED
LOSING HIS LOVED
ONES ABOVE
ALL ELSE...
