The titleisareference to the popular Kyoto rakugo tale
A Fox of SevenDisguises' (written t#, aka'Seven-Time
Fox).Thestory tellsof apair of men,Kiroku andSeihachi
that accidentallyincite theireof amystical fox-spirit
(knownasa 'kitsune, whichis also the word for fox
in Japanese)while traveling to Ise Shrine.Initsanger,
the fox visits the pair seven more times in different
disguises to play tricks onand torment them.
Anyway thisideaof a trickster fox-spiritis
commonin Japanese folktales, andis similar to the
coyote trickster godthat appearsin Native American
mythologies.Oda has inverted the concepthere, where
Onimaru, dlearly amystical fox, takes on just one disguise
to bring fortune toKawamatsuandhismissionduringhis
