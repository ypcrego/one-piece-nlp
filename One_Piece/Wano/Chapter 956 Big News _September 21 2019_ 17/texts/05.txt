THESE
ROUND TABLES
ARE IN A SORRY
STATE.
BUT
THISYEAR...
WAS BAD.
AND THEY
SET THEIR
SUBORDINATES
AT EACH OTHER'S
THROATS. RESOURCES
AND TECHNOLOGY
ARE BUT TOOLS IN
THESEFIGHTS.
I SAY
WE HAVE
PEACE.
HOW MANY
KINGS ARE ACTUALLY
WILLING TO SPEAK FOR
THEIR PEOPLE, OR FOR
LESS FORTUNATE
NATIONS?
WELL,
AS LONG AS
SI 01 ON
SPILLED,
THE STRONG
COUNTRIES ARE
CONSTANTLY
STARING EACH
OTHER DOWN,
5C
EVEN IF
THEY DO MANAGE TO
JOIN HANDS, THESE
COUNTRIES'LL SMILE
WHILE STEPPING ON
EACH OTHER'S
FEET.
EACH HAS
THEIR OWN
PROBLEMS
AT HOME.
AND HISTORY
BETWEEN NATIONS
MEANS THE ROOTS
OF GRUDGESTO
RUN DEEP.
PRECLUIDE
REAL EGALI-
TARIANISM.
THERE'S NO
WAY THAT 5O-PLUS
COUNTRIES COULD EVER
GATHER IN ONE PLACE
AND ALL AGREE TO
GET ALONG.
I AGREE THAT
CONVERSATIONS
AMONG KINGS
ARE RATHER
TOUCHY.
DIFFERENCES
IN WEALTH AND
RELIGION
