BEEN THROUGH
A TERRIBLE
ORDEAL!!

THE BEASTS OF THE
FOREST INTO A LABOUR
FORCE TO BRING IT THIS

INCOMPLETE.

THIS COUNTRY,EVER
SUFFERING IN THIS
FREEZING CLIMATE!

...HE WAS
UNABLE TO FULLY
TRANSFER THEM
INTO REALITY.HE
DID NOT HAVE THE
TECHNOLOGY AND
THE FUNDING TO
BRING THE SYSTEM
TO COMPLETION.
WE ARE ALWAYS
AWAITING HIS SAFE
RETURN.IF YOU
