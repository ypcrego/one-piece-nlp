DO YOU SEE
ANYONE ELSE?
...SUNSET
Sn NOdn s
COTOTHE
CASTLE.THEY
WILL NOT FOLLOW
YOUTHERE...!!
IN OTHER WORDS,THESE
BABOONS GREW UPMITATING THOSE
VICIOUS HUMANS, LEARNED TO USE
THEIR WEAPONS,AND BECAME
WARRIORS OF THE FOREST.
yOU
TALKING
ABOUT
IAM
GOING...
TO SEA!!!
YET IFTHOSE
BEASTS TOO
TAKE UP ARMS,
FRIGHTFULLY
POWERFUL.
THE PERFECT
PERHAPS,FOR
A CONCEITED
YOUNG FOOL
WHEN I FIRST DECIDED
TO MAKE THIS PLACE MY
HOME,IT WAS STILL THICK WITH
THE STENCH OF BLOOD AND
SMOKE,AND THE GROUND WAS
PAVED WITH CORPSES.
UNTIL JUST
SEVEN YEARS AGO,
THERE WAS A MIGHTY
WAR RAGING UPON
THIS LAND.
I DON'T
TAKE ORDERS
FROM you!!!
ITIS DUE TO
THEIR WEAPONS
AND THEIR WISDOM
THAT HUMANS STAND
SUPREME OVER
BEASTS.
