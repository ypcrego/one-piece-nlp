IT'S CROCODILE
SKIN.I'M GONNA
GO SELLIT
.BUT IT IS
SEPARATED
FROM GREY
TERMINAL BY
A MIGHTY,
IMPASSABLE
STONE WALL.
THE ONLY WAY
THROUGH THIS
WALL IS THROUGH
A MIGHTYDOOR
KNOWN ONLY AS
THE GREAT GATE
...
THE RESIDENTS OF THE
TRASH HEAP MAKE THEIR
LIVING BY OCCASIONALLY
HEADING INTO THE CITY AND
SELLING RECYCLED GOODS.
YET THEY NEVER THINK
TO LIVE IN THE CITY
ITSELF.NOBODY IS FOOL
ENOUGH TO WISH MISERY
UPON HIMSELF
HEY,WHAT'S

GOT THERE?

TREASURE
-HUNTING
TIME!!

FOOD WILL

..LIES GREY TERMINAL
OTHERWISE KNOWN
AS THE TRASH HEAP.
STILL
FURTHER
NORTH LIES
THECITY
S BROUGHT
THROUGH THIS
GATE IN MASSIVE
QUANTITIES
A DAYTRASH
GATHERED
FROM ACROSS
THE LAND...
