...BEHIND
ME.
EVENIF HE
FOUND HIMSELF
FACING AMASSIVE
ARMY HE COULDN'T
HOPE TO DEFEAT...
IF THEY ALL FLED
TOGETHER HE WOULD
BE PLACING HIS CREW IN
DANGER ALONGSIDE HIM.
SOPERHAPS...
IT'S NOT THAT HE
WOULDN'TRUN...BUT
THAT HE WOULD DO
ANYTHING HE COULD TO
STOP THE ENEMY FROM
GOING AFTER HIS CREW...
HE WOULDNT LETTHE
ENEMY GET AWAY.
TRUE ENOUGH.BUT
HE WOULD NEVER RUN.
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HE
LOVED WERE STANDING
THEREBEHIND HIM.
WHATDID HE
HAVE A DEATH
WISH?KNOWING
WHEN TO RUN IS
AN IMPORTANT
PART OF
BATTLE.
I'M NOT SURE
BUT...I
THINK THAT
WAS WHY.
LUFFY
WAS RIGHT
THERE...
...ROGER
WOULD NEVER
RUN.HE WOULD
ALWAYS STAND
HIS GROUND
