I SEE...SOIF WE
LAND DIRECTLY,
WE WOULD GET
BLOCKED BY THE
RIVERS.
YES.ALSOIN
THOSE RIVERS
THERE ARE
MAN-EATING
FISH.
THERE IS ONLY
ONE WAY TO GET
THERE,AND ITS
VIA THE MILKY
ROAD FROM THIS
ISLAND.
YOU MUST LSE
THE DIAL BOAT
AND PASS
THROUGHTHE
FOREST,WHERE
THE PRIESTS
RESIDE.
THE BIGGEST
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THIS
OLD MAP AND THE
CURRENT GOD'S
ISLAND IS THE
ADDITION OF THE
MILKY ROADS.
THOSE CLOUD
RIVERS?
YES.I HEARD THAT
THERE IS A MAIN
CLOUD RIVER AS
WELL AS HUNDREDS
OFOTHERS
SACRIFICIAL
ALTAR
UPPER YARD
ANGEL BEACH
E
N*S
THIS MAP IS VERY
OLD...BUTITLOOKS
CORRECT...
THE SACRIFICIAL
ALTAR IS IN THE
LIPPER LEFT,WHICH
IS THE NORTHEAST.
AH.MISTER,WHAT
IF WE GO AROUND
THE ISLAND
INSTEAD OF
THROUGH IT!?
NO...YOU CAN'T GET
TO THE ALTAR ON
FOOT IF YOU LAND
NEAR IT.
SO OTHER THAN
ENTERING VIA THE
CENTRAL MILKY
ROAD,THERE IS NO
OTHER WAY.
..HERE IS
WHERE YOU
ARE.
