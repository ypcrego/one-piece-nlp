IN OTHER WORDS...
THIS SOUNDING OFTHE

INTERPRETED AS A TRIBUTE
TO THE ENDING OF ONE AGE
AND THE BEGINNING
OF ANEW.
SIXTEEN CHIMES TO
MARINEFORD"...WHAT

AT THE END AND THE
BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR..
THE BELL IS SOUNDED EIGHT
TIMES TO SEE OUT THE OLD
YEAR,AND EIGHT TIMES
TO SEE IN THE NEW.
AS SUCHTHIS MARINE
TRADITION INVOLVES
