THE LAY OF
POWER AMONGST
THE PIRATES,
TOO,SHOULD BE
UNDERGOING
CHANGE.
WEMUST
SELECT
ONLYTHOSE
INDIVIDUALS
WITH GREAT
INFLUENCE.
IT IS ALWAYS THOSE
WITH THE D WHO CAUSE
SUCH TROUBLE... JUST
LIKE PORTGAS...
IT WOULD SEEM THAT
THE NAME HAS BECOME
RATHER TOO EXPOSED
AT THIS POINT...
WE SHOULD
FIRST WAIT TO
SEE HOW THE
NEW WORLD
RESPONDS.
IF ANYBODY
CAN PUT A STOP
TO HIS ADVANCE,
IT WOULD HAVE
TO BE THE YONKOU
THEMSELVES.
OR ELSE MARCO THE
PHOENIXAND THE
OTHER REMNANTS OF
THE WHITEBEARD
PIRATES.
HOW WILL WE
GO ABOUT FILLING
THE THREE EMPTY
SEATS IN THE
SHICHIBUKAI?
.HE HAS A CLEAR HEAD
START.THERE ISAFTER ALL,
NO RECORD OF ANY MAN
BEFORE HIM SUCCESSFULLY
CONSUMING TWO DEVIL'S
FRUITS.
THE BALANCE
BEEEEEEE
THREE GREAT
POWERS HAS
FALLEN INTO A
TERRIBLE STATE.
AMONGST THOSE
PIRATES STRIVING TO
FILL THE VACANT SEAT
IN THE YONKOU...
SIGNIFICANCE OF
REPRESENTING
INTERRACIAL
HARMONY...HIS
LOSS WILL BE
SORELYFELT.
TOO HAS FINALLY
us...WHENWE
INDUCTEDHIM INTO
THE SHICHIBUKAL
HE IS ALL TOO
FAMILIAR WITH
THE TERRITORY
THAT WHITEBEARD
CONTROLLED.
IHARDLY
EXPECT HIM TO
COME OUT INTO
THE OPEN AFTER
ALL THIS TIME.
AND ONE OF
THOSE ROOKIES
EXCEEDING A HUNDRED
HAS ALREADYFALLEN
PREY TOHM.
WHAT MANNER
OF CONNECTION
DOES THE BOY
HAVE WITH
RAYLEIGH...?
BLACKBEARD
HAS ALREADY
BEGUN TO TAKE
ACTION IN THE
NEW WORLD...
.IT'S JUST ONE THING AFTER
ANOTHER WITH THIS STRAW HAT
LUFFY BOY...IT SEEMS ODDLY
APPROPRIATE THAT HE IS
GARP'S GRANDSON...
REDLINE,
HOLY LAND OF
MARIEJOA:THE
