WHO HAVE LED THE
MARINES FROM THE
FRONT LINES SINCE
ROGER'S AGE...
.WILL BE RETIRING
FROM ACTIVE DUTY...
THOS SI SSS
SERIOUS NEWS.
THE GREATEST
OF THEM ALL
WAS NEWGATE
WITHTHIS
PIRATE AGE ON
THE VERGE OF
REBIRTH...
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
KONG-SAN...FOR
MY SUCCESSOR
AS FLEET ADMIRAL
..
I WOULD LIKE
TONOMINATE
AOKIJI.
THERE ARE STILL
MANY PIRATES
OUT THERE WORTHY
OF BEING CALLED
"LEGENDARY"...
.NOT LEAST THE
ESCAPED PRISONERS
FROM LEVEL SIX OF
IMPEL DOWN.
S THIS ANY
TIME TO HAVE OLD
MEN RUNNING THE
MARINES?
JUSTICE ISA
SYSTEM OF VALUES
T CANNOT
OVERCOME THE GAP
OF GENERATIONS...
..YESI
THINK I WILL
ACCEPT YOUR
PROPOSITION.
THAT DOES NOT
SOUND LIKE A BAD
WAY TO SPEND
MY REMAINING
YEARS...
