IT'SA
HIGHLY CIVILIZED
COUNTRY WITHIN
GRAND LINE,
AND IT
LSED TO BE A
PEACEFUL ONE
AT THAT TOO...
LONG AGO.
THAT
ORGANI-
ZATION WAS
"BAROQUE
WORKS."
BUT OTHER
THAN THAT FACT,
IDIDN'TKNOW
ANYTHING ELSE
NOR COULD I DO
ANYTHING ABOUT
BAROQUE WORKS.
ONEDAY,
I HAPPENED
TOHEAR OF
A CERTAIN
ORGANIZATION.
DUE TO RADICAL
ALABASTAN
REVOLUTIONARIES,
MY COUNTRY IS
CURRENTLYINA
STATE OF CHAOS.
NOCANT SAY
THAT IHAVE.
THE PAST FEW
YEARS HAVE
BEENMIRED BY
REVOLUTIONARY
ACTIVITIES.
APPARENTLY,
IT WAS BAROQUE
WORKS WHO HAD
BEEN INSTIGATING
THE REVOLL-
TIONARIES.
HAVE YOU
HEARD OF
A KINGDOM
CALLED
ALABASTA?
LONG
AGO?
