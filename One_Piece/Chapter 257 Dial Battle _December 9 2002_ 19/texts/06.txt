A WEAPON!

DURING A WAR,
THEPOWER

BE DEVASTATING.
IF EQUIPPED IN
A BIRD'S MOUTH,

IS BORN.
FORTHAT
REASON,
THE REECT DIAL

LSED...

BENEFICIAL...
ON THE
OTHER HAND,
THE FLAME DIAL
THAT STORES
FLAME...
ITIS ALSO SAIO,
HOWEVER,THAT THE DIAL
WAS SOSTRONG THAT
IT COULD KILL THE

LIKE A DOUBLE-EDGED
SWORD.

THAT IS STILL
TRUE--
HOWEVER,ANY

ITHOUGHT
THAT THE DIALS
