2 YEARS AGO THIS WAS
JUST A WASTELAND
WITHOUT ANY ICE OR
FIRE.
SURPRISINGLY,AT THAT
TIME MOST OF THE
POISONOUS MATTER HAD
ALREADY VANISHED.
CHOSE THIS AS THE SPOT
FOR THEIR DECISIVE
BATTLE.
THIS WAS THE SCENE OF
A BATTLE SO ENORMOUS
IT CHANGED THE
WEATHER!!
NOACTUALLYIT'S
UNNATURAL FOR
THERE TO BE THIS
MUCH GAS.
NOONE CAN SET FOOT
ON AN ISLAND THAT'S
SOCONTAMINATEDWITH
POISONOUS GAS!!
THAT'S WHY,AT THE TIME,
AOKIJI AND AKAINU
FIRST OF ALL,I
DON'T EVEN SEE
STRAWHAT LUFFY'S
SHIP AROUND
HERE....
