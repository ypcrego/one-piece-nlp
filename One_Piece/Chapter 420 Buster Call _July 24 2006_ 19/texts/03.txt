Eiichiro Oda
Every day,the world's
population grows by
200O00.There are over
5 billion people in the world
Every now and thenI think
about how mysterious it is
that even though the
people of the world eat
Meat every day,there are
Still plenty oP animals
around. So to all our animal
PriendsI say,Thank you
Por the Pood.
Volome 44,Start!!!
