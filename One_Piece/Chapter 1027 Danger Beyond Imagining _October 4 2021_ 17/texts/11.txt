THERE
WOULDN'T
BE TIME TO
EVACUATE THE
CAPITAL!
YOU WERE
ABLE TO SUMMON
FLAME CLOUDS!!
THAT MEANS YOU'VE
GOT A SHOT!!
THIS IS AN
UNBELIEVABLE
DISASTER...!!
HIS
CLOUDS WOULD
DISAPPEAR, AND
ONIGASHIMA
WOULD BE SENT
HURTLING
TOWARDS THE
SURFACE!!
EVEN
AT THIS
DISTANCE...
IT'D BE EVEN
WORSE IF HE
WERE TORUN
OUT OF STEAM
EARLY.
THE WHOLE
ISLAND IS
BASICALLY A
GIANT BOMB!!
CRUSHING
EVERYONE IN
THE CAPITAL!!
ONIGASHIMA
IS STOCKED WITH
MORE WEAPONS AND
GUNPOWDER THAN
YOU CAN IMAGINE..!!
IF WE DO
NOTHING, IT'LL
LAND LIKE KAIDO
INTENDED...
AND THERE
IS NO TELLING
IF MY POWERS
ARE EXACTLY
LIKE KAIDO'S!!
