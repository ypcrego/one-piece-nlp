SOBACK TO MY QUESTION.IN CHAPTER
372 OFVOL 39SANJI USESPARAGE
SHOT.IF YOU GETPARAGED,EXACTLY
HOW BEAUTIFUL CAN YOU GET? TELL ME!
IMBALANCE WOULD JUST CREEP PEOPLE OUT.
ONE PIECE HAS ABOUT 1O-11 SOMETIMES!WHY IS
THAT!? IT'S BEEN STRANGELY THICK AS OF LATE
GOOD WORK,ODA-SAN PLEASE HEAR ME OUTTHIS
QUESTION HAS BEEN DRIVING ME NUTS!!USUALLY A
BOUND VOLUME CONTAINS ABOUT 9 CHAPTERS,BUT
THAT'S PROBABLY PART OF THE REASON TOO LAUGHS).
WE'RE TALKING COMPLETE MAKEOVER HERE.JUST AS YOU SAW WITH WANZE,
YOU GET HOLLYWOOD-MOVIE-STAR-DROP-DEAD-GORGEOUS LOOKS.BUT IT
HAS TWO SMALL CATCHES. ONEBECAUSE IT'S SANJI WE'RE TALKING ABOUT,
HED NEVER KICK A WOMAN.SECONDONLY YOUR FACE CHANGES.SO IF
YOUR BODY'S LIKE A POTATOEVEN THOUGH YOU'D HAVE A PRETTY FACE,THE
YOU'RE RIGHT. TO TALK SHOPCOMIC VOLUMES ARE USUALLY LIMITED TO
AROUND 184 PAGES.COMMONLY,9 CHAPTERS FIT PERFECTLY,BUT IN MY CASE
THEY JUST HAVE TO HAVE 1O OR 1II SOMETIMES DEMAND IT SELFISHLY.
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY IT'S SERVICE TO MY READERSAND IT ALSO GOES
LOTS OF COMPLAINTS OVER HOW THE VOLUMES WERE GETTING THINNER..SO
