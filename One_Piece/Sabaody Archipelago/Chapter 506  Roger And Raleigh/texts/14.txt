THAT DAY,
IN THE SQUARE...
I HEARDTHAT THE
YOUNG FACES OF
THE PIRATES,WHO
ARE MAKING NAMES
FOR THEMSELVES
ALL OVER THE
OCEANS NOW,
WERE LINED UP,
WATCHING...
THE EXECUTION OF THE
PIRATE KING TOOK
THE WORLD BY STORM...
"PARTNER..."
CHANGED THE
EVENT INTO THE RAISING
OF THE CURTAIN OF THE
"NEW PIRATE AGE"...
"IAIN'T
GONNA DIE...
BUT ROGER'S
WORDS,BEFORE
HISDEATH,
THEYHAD
PLANNED THE PUBLIC
EXECUTION TO BE A
WARNING TO ALL
OTHER PIRATES,
ROGER TURNED
HIMSELF IN..
HE WAS ARRESTED...
TAKEN TO THETOWN
WHERE HE WAS BORN
LOGUETOWN
IN EAST BLUE,
WHERE HIS PUBLIC
EXECUTION WAS
ANNOUNCED.
I DIDNTGO.
THE WORLD
GOVERNMENT,
THE MARINES...
MUST HAVE BEEN
SURPRISED.
THIS
IS WHAT HIS
LAST WORDS
WERETO ME.
