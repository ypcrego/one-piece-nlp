O:WHAT THEY DID WAS LSE THEIR HEELS TO CRACK OPEN A BARREL OF
BEER TO CELEBRATE THEIR ENTRANCE INTO THE GRAND LINE.YOU

IN OTHER WORDS,THE SAILING CEREMONY IS THE BIGGEST AND MOST

BREAK A BOTTLE OF LIQUOR ON THE BOW OF THE SHIP,ANDIF THE
BOTTLE DOESN'T BREAK,THE SHIP IS CURSED WITH BAD LUCK.IT'S A

BREAKING HAS TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.I'VE EVENHEARD THAT IN
