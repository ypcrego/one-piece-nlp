BUT ROGER WAS
HAPPY ABOUT IT..
HE ENJOYED IT,
SAWITASA
WAY TO WORK OUT
A PLAN FOR THE
UNFORESEEABLE
FUTURE.
NO ONE
KNOWS WHERE
THE MEN WHO
RISKED THEIR
LIVES WITH
HIM ARE NOW,
ORWHAT
THEY'RE
DOING...
AND ONE
YEAR AFTER
THE BREAKUP-
ITWAS THE
SAME FOR
PARTYING...
FIGHTING...
FOR A MAN WHO
IS ABOUT TO DIE,
TITLES LIKE THAT
ARE MEANINGLESS.
AT HIS ORDERS,
THE JOLLYROGER
PIRATES
WERE SECRETLY
DISBANDED...
ONE AFTER THE
OTHER,THEY
DISAPPEARED..
HE WASA MAN
ANYTHING AND
EVERYTHING WITH
FLAIR AND POMP..
