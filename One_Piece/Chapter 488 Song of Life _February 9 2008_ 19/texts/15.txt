NOW COMES A STORM
THROUGH THE FAR-OFF SKY
NOW THE WAVES ARE DANCING,
BEAT UPON THE DRUMS
IF yOU LOSE YOUR NERYE,
THIS BREATH COULD BE YOUR LAST
B4T IF yOUJST HOLD ON THE
MORNING SUN WILL RISE
GOING TO DELIVER BINKS SAKE
WE ARE PIRATES
SLICING THROUGH THE SEAS
THE WAVES OUR PILLOWS,
THE SHIP OUR ROOST
FLyING THE PROUD SKULL
ON OUR FLAGS AND SAILS
GOING TO DELIVER BINKS' SAKE
FOLLOWING THE SEA BREEZE
RIDING ON THE WAVES
FAR ACROSS THE SALTY DEEPS
THE MERRY EVENING SUN
PAINTINGCIRCLES IN THE SKY,
AS THE BIRDS SING
FAREWELL TO THE HARBOUR,
TO My OLD HOMETOWN
LETS ALL SING OUT WITH A
'NOO
AS THE SHIP SETS SAIL
WAVES OF GOLD AND SILVER
DISSOLVE TO SALTY SPRAY
AS WE ALL SET SAIL TO
THE ENDS OF THE SEA
