iNOANUI
WITHOUT APOWERFUL
NAME LIKETHAT TO PROTECT

COLLAPSE.THAT'S JUST HOW
SERIOUS THE PIRATE PROBLEM
IS AROUND THESE PARTS.

EXPECTS A HUGE
DELIVERY OF DELICIOUS
SWEETS FROM US EACH
MONTH.THAT'S WHAT
THE FACTORY'S FOR
BIGMAM
TOBIG MAM,
I SUPPOSE IT'S
LIKE A BUSINESS
OFSORTS...
YOU COULD SAY
THAT.THOUGHOF
COURSE,WHITEBEARD
NEVER ASKED FOR
ANYTHING IN RETURN...
YOU'LL SEE FLAGS LIKE
THAT ONE AT THE ENTRANCE
TO THE ISLANDAND IN THE
PORTAS WELL.IT'S THAT
FLAG THAT'S PROTECTING
OUR ISLAND RIGHT NOW!
THE FLAG BELONGS
TOA PIRATEFROM THE
NEW WORLD,NAME OF
CHARLOTTE RINRIN!!
BEFORE THE
WAR, WE HAD
WHITEBEARD'S
NAME...
AND THAT KEPT
US SAFE FROM THE
HANDS OF OTHER
PIRATES.THESE DAYS,
BIG MAM DOES THE
SAME JOB.
STILL,IF SHE'S
PROTECTING YOU JUST
LIKE WHITEBEARDTHIS BIG
MAM MUST BE A PRETTY ALL
RIGHT SORT OF WOMAN.
