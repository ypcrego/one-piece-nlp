...THIS
ISLANDIS MY
TERRITORY!!!
.TO CHANGE
THE COURSE
OFHISTORY...
YOU ALL MUST HAVE
WITNESSEDTHE TRUTH
FOR YOURSELVES
ON THE SHABONDY
ARCHIPELAGO.
THE DEEPER-SET
WERE THE DISCRIMINATORY
PREJUDICES THAT COULD BE
FOUND AMONG THEM...!!IT
WAS INTHE MIDSTOFTHIS
SEEMINGLY HOPELESS
SITUATION THAT TWO
INDIVIDUALS ROSE UP,
AND MADE THEIR
VALIANT ATTEMPTS...
uu...
FROMNOW
ON...
BUT THE HATRED
THANTTTANS
FELT TOWARDS OUR
KIND LIVEDON...!
AND SO IT WAS
THAT THE CLOSER
ONE LOOKED TO THE
CENTRAL SPHERES
OF GOVERNMENT,WHO
HELD SWAY OVER
HUMAN-FISHMAN
RELATIONS...
...WAS
NONE OTHER
THAN THE LATE
WHITEBEARD...!!!
AND SO PEACE
RETURNED TO
OUR ISLAND.
ITISA
SAD TRUTH THAT
THE GREATER THE
AUTHORITY A PERSON
POSSESSES,THE
MORE HE TENDS TO
FEAR CHANGE.
THE MAN WHO
FREED OUR
KINDFROM
THAT TERROR..
