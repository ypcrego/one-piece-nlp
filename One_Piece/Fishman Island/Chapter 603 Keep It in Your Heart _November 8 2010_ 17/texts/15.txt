KUMA...
TO"PROTECT
THE SHIP OF THE
STRAW HAT PIRATES
UNTIL THE DAY ONE
OFTHEIR MEMBERS
RETURNS".
THAT'S WHYFORTHE
PAST TWO YEARS,DESPITE
HAVING NONE OF HIS ORIGINAL
MEMORIES...HE'S BEEN
FOLLOWING THE ORDERS
OF HIS FORMER SELF,
WAITING UNTIL THE DAY
WE CAME BACK.
I DONT SEE ANY
WAY FOR US TO
FINDOUT WHAT HE
WAS TRULY THINKING
AT THIS POINT...
.BUT HOLD THAT
KNOWLEDGE IN
YOUR HEARTS. WHEN
IT COMES DOWN TO
IT,BARTHOLOMEW
KUMA...
IDONT
REALLY KNOW
MUCH ABOUT
MYDAD.
BUT THAT
BEAR-GUY
WAS A
GOOD GUY
AFTER ALL
HUH...?
HAD ALLOWED
HIM TO INCLUDE A
SINGLE MISSION OF
HH NI NMO SIH
PROGRAMMING
THE ONLY THING
I CAN THINK OF IS
LUFFY'S DAD,SINCE
HE'S THE LEADER OF
THE REVOLUTIONARY
ARMY.
THEMAN
RESPONSIBLE
FORHIS
"RESTRUCTURING",
DR.VEGAPUNK...
IFWE THINK
ABOUT HIS
CONNECTION TO
THE REVOLU-
TIONARIES...
HE COULDN'T
POSSIBLY HAVE
KNOWN WHAT WE
WOULD DO AFTER
HE'D SENT US OFF
TOALL THOSE
DIFFERENT PLACES!!
DID HE WAIT WITH
THE SHIPDESPITE
THAT?!EVEN THOUGH
HIS PERSONALITY
WAS GONE?!
THAT'S JUST
COMPLETELY
SCREWED UP...
WHY WOULD HE
GO SOFAR
FORUS...?
IT LOOKS LIKE IN
THE END,WE'VE ONLY
BEEN ABLE TO SPEND
THESE TWO VALUABLE
YEARS APART...
...BECAUSE THAT
MAN CHOSETO
FIGHT IN OUR
STEAD...!!
