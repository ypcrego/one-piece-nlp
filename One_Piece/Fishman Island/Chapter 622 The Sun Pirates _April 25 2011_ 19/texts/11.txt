FOR"FREEDOM"
ANDLIBERTY".
FUTURE
GENERATIONS OF
FISHMEN, WHO HAVE
DONE NO WRONG,
WILL SUFFER FOR
THE PAIN WE HAVE
CALSED.
WEWILL
NOT TAKE
A LIFE!!!
BUT ULTIMATELY,
ALL I DID WAS
FREE THOSE WHO
WERE SUFFERING
FROM THEIR
OPPRESSION!!
..THEN IT WILL LEAD
ONLYTOFURTHER
TRAGEDY WHEN
THEIR OWN REVENGE
IN RETURN.
BUT WE WILL
STAND FIRM TO
OUR MORALS
I MAYHAVE
VIOLATED THEIR
WORTHLESS
LAWS...
IF WE WALLOW
IN OUR RESENTMENT
AND START ACTIVELY
TAKING REVENGE
UPON THE HUMANS...
THE SAME

ACTIONS AT
