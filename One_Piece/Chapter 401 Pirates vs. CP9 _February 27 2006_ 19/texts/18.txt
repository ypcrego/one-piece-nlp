O:OKAY.THIS QUESTION CAME UP MORE OFTEN THAN I
EXPECTED.CAPTAIN KURO'S SHAKUSHI"CAPPEARED IN
VOLUME SWAS A PRETTY STRONG TECHNIQUE.I
WOULD SAY THAT IN TERMS OF SPEED,THEYRE ABOUT
EQUAL.HOWEVER, WHEN CAPTAIN KURO LSES HIS
TECHNIQUE, HE MOVES SO FAST THAT HE DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW WHO HE'S ATTACKING,WHILE THE CP9 MEMBERS
CAN CONTROL THEMSELVES AT THAT SPEED.SO BASI-
CALLY,IF THEYFOUGHT,CP9 WOULD HAVE AN OVER-
RHIODA!! IN VOLUME 36YOU WROTE WHEN YOU'RE
TAKING A TEST,IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER
JUST WRITE INSTRUMENTAL,SOI REALLY TRIED
