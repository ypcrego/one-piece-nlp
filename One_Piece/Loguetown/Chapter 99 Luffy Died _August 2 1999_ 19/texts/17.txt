BUT THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT
THAT STRAW-HAT
SMILED!
S..SMILE!? I'M SURE
EVEN THE MOST WICKED
PIRATE WOULD TURN
PALE AND COWER AT THE
MOMENT OF HIS DEATH.
HEY...HAVE YOU
EVER SEEN A PIRATE
WHO SMILED AT HIS
EXECUTIONSTAND?
HE SMILED
THE SAME WAY
THAT THE PIRATE
KING DID,
22YEARS AGO
IN THAT VERY
SAME SPOT!
CAPTAIN!
SHOULDN'T
WE...
