THATIS
THE SECRET
BEEEITNE
REALITY
HERE.
YEP,THAT
IS CORRECT.
NOOP NONTPS
THE SOULS FROM
SETTLING INTO
ANIMALS.
INTO RANDOM OBJECTS OR
THINGS AND THEY END UP
GETTING "HUMANIZED!JUST
TO BE CLEAR, THE SOULS
CANNOT ENTER A CORPSE
OR THEBODY OF
AND
SPRINKLES THOSE
"HUMAN SOULS"ALL
THROUGHOUTTHE
ISLAND.
THAT'S ALL HANDLED
BY THE "INCARNATIONS
MADE OUT OF LINLIN...
I MEAN, BIG MOM'S
OUSNMO
ANDTHAT
HUIMANOID
RABBIT
TOO..
IS THAT
WHY WE CAME
ACROSS A TALKING
CROCODILE?
AS FOR THE
COTETTTON
AND ASSIGN-
MEEESEEESE
PIECES OF
SOUL...
WITH THAT
POWER,SHE TAKES
SOEOTOTEF
LIFESPANS,
THEY'RE
CALLEDTHE
"HOMIES".
NOW
IT'S ALL
STARTING
TOMAKE
SENSE!
WHAT AN
OUTRAGEOUS
ABILITY!
...THAT
CHOCOLATE TOWN
WE VISITED EARLIER
ALSO HAD LOTS OF
LIVING THINGS THAT
HAD NO BUSINESS
BEING ALIVE..
SO THOSE GUYS
STANDING OVER THERE
ARE JUST SOME OF THE
THINGS THAT THOSE SOULS
I MENTIONED EARLIER
INSIDE.
SHE'S ABLE TO
FREELY INTERACT
"SOULS".
