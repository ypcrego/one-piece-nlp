HAHAHAH.
THAT'S A VERY
HUMAN WAY OF
THINKING.
I KNOW MOST SPECIES
THAT LIVE ABOVE
THE OCEAN TEND
TO HAVE A HEAVY
RESEMBLANCE
WITHIN FAMILIES.
...THAT LEADS
YOU TO CLASSIFY
PEOPLE BASED
ON THEIR
APPEARANCES.
SOFOR INSTANCE,
IFAN OCTOPUS
MERMAID GIVES
BIRTH TOA
SHARK MERMAN..
THAT JUST MEANS
THAT SOMEWHERE
WAY BACK ON THEIR
FAMILYTREE,THEY
HAD A SHARK MERMAN
FOR AN ANCESTOR
IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT
FOR USTO
UNDERSTAND THAT
HUMAN INSTINCT...
PAREN
AND
FISHMEN AND
MERFOLK CARRY
A LONG,LONG
MEMORY OF THEIR
HERITAGE IN
THEIR GENES.
ON FISHMAN ISLAND,IT'S
PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE
TOPREDICT WHAT A CHILD
WILL LOOK LIKE JUST
FROM LOOKING AT
THEIR PARENTS.
BUTIT'S
ALITTLE
DIFFERENT
FOR US.
I THOUGHT,SINCE
YOU'RE TOM-SAN'S
BROTHER,THERE'D BE
A LITTLE MORE
RESEMBLANCE,
YOU KNOW...?
